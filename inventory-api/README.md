# Inventory API

* This API maintains the availability and prices for a specific product.
* Products are added using an unique ID (common to Catalog and other APIs).
* The API will support CRUD operations on Products (logical delete).
* Another resource is a Purchase, which will contain details about incoming and outgoing movements for products.
